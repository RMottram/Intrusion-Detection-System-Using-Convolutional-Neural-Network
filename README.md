# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Intrusion Detection using neural network is a very popular research work. I have developed a CNN model with hybrid feature selection which helps the model for better inference and generalization capability using NSL-KDD benchmark dataset.
